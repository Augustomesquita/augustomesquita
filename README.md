# Hi, I'm Augusto 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻
I am a person who likes to share knowledge, be it through forums, chats, or events. I really love talking about software architecture and the best practices for the development process. In my spare time, I become a writer at LazyDev and a teacher at Udemy. My main goal in these places is to provide content relevant to the software development community through articles and courses.
